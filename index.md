# About

Hi, my name is Naif and I'm a software developer.

I have a degree in IT and experince building web back-ends using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org). I wrote about [learning](learning.md) resources that I've used and what I'm doing right [now](now.md).

These pages are obviously hosted on my [GitHub](https://github.com/nnnaif).
