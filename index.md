# About

Hi, my name is Naif and I'm a software developer.

I have a degree in IT and some experince building back-ends using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org). I've listed some great [Learning](learning.md) resources that I recommend and what I'm doing right [now](now.md).

These pages are obviously hosted on my [GitHub](https://github.com/nnnaif).
