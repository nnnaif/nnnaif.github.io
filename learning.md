# Learning

## Books:
- [Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach](https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Networking-Top-Down-Approach-7th/dp/0133594149): An easy to read book that gives an overview on each layer of the [TCP/IP model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite) without going too deep into technical specs.

## Lectures/Video Courses:
- [CS50x](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science): This is a great introductory course into programming and CS in general as it doesn't only focus on writing code but how computers interact with and run that code.
  
- [Node.js](https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-the-complete-guide): I tried a few Node.js courses before descovering this one; unlike others, the instructor goes through almost every line but without
overexplaining.

- [Flutter](https://www.udemy.com/course/flutter-bootcamp-with-dart): A decent intro into Flutter and Dart as it comes recommended by the Flutter team. Overall, and because of how long this course is and how easy Flutter is to comprehend, I recommend experienced devs to follow a shorter tutorial and go through the [Flutter docs](https://flutter.dev/docs) instead.
